          nik hindi ardham kaadhu kada re..idhe dani lyrics..
          This heart has gone mad
          Now only you can explain it
              I see my world in you
                  My world, you are a wanderer
                                  I am lucky that by fate
              I have found you like this
              I have got permission from God to love you..
        </p>
